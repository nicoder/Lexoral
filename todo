UX:
  Can't copy
  * Should be able to select nothing
  * Should have nothing selected at first
  Reenable key presses when text is selected
  Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)
  - undo / redo support

  -- make logo background transparent
  -- support cut + paste
  -- support firefox + safari + edge


Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
