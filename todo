  Home & End don't work
  Some kind of bug with autocompleting a word and the cursor being at the very start of the next section
  ctrl + left takes 2 presses
  ctrl + up / down should move up and down lines
  Some kind of button help
  Alt up/down should control volume
  Alt left/right should control context
  
  * Should entering first character on placeholder replace it?
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
