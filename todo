audio:
  Option to continue / restart
  multiple play at once sometimes when click + drag

sections:
  - automatically adjust section timings based on audio envelope
  - automatically determine paragraph boundaries based on audio envelope
  - automatically combine sections

  -- manually split a section
  -- manually combine a section
  -- manually add a section
  -- manually delete a section
  -- manually adjust section timings
  
UX:
  AutoSave
  Shouldn't combine paragraph toggle history with text edit history

  Some kind of help / tutorial
  
  * Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  * Should be able to select nothing
  * Should have nothing selected at first
  * Page up / down don't work
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)
  - autosave

  -- support cut + paste

Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
  updateSelection is called way too much
  changing paragraphs rerenders everything

Features:
  Add export functionality
  -- Speaker diarization
