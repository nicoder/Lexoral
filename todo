UX:
  _Some kind of help / tutorial_

  - Add export dialog where you can choose file name and swap between txt / srt / copy to clipboard
  - Clicky buttons for everything
  
  * Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  * Should be able to select nothing
  * Should have nothing selected at first
  * Page up / down don't work
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)

  -- support cut + paste

Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
  updateSelection is called way too much
  changing paragraphs rerenders everything
