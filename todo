Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
  updateSelection is called way too much
  changing paragraphs rerenders everything
  transform is called for every section on every edit

test with <4 hour files

Slight jank when scrolling up to a paragraph that is hidden then becomes visible but has been edited while hidden - either through undo/redo or a second client. Should be solved by temporarily unhiding things and recalculating height when they are edited.
