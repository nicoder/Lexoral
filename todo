audio:
  Option to continue / restart
  When playing, if you select a non-overlapping audio selection sometimes a section stays green
  Expect it to automatically play
  fix the next word going green and starting to play when not looping
  fix audio playing multiple times sometimes when skipping around quickly

sections:
  - automatically adjust section timings based on audio envelope
  - automatically determine paragraph boundaries based on audio envelope
  - automatically combine sections

  -- manually adjust paragraph boundaries
  -- manually split a section
  -- manually combine a section
  -- manually add a section
  -- manually delete a section
  -- manually adjust section timings
  
UX:
  Should be able to select nothing
  Should have nothing selected at first
  up + down arrows when no dropdown shouldn't do anything
  Reenable key presses when text is selected
  Shift + arrow keys doesnâ€™t select text
  Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)
  - undo / redo support

  -- make logo background transparent
  -- support cut + paste
  -- support firefox + safari + edge


Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
