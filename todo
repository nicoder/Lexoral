audio:
  Option to continue / restart

sections:
  - automatically adjust section timings based on audio envelope
  - automatically determine paragraph boundaries based on audio envelope
  - automatically combine sections

  -- manually split a section
  -- manually combine a section
  -- manually add a section
  -- manually delete a section
  -- manually adjust section timings
  
UX:
  AutoSave
  Undo selection location isn't correct when it's affected by code mutating the selection (eg ctrl + backspace)
  Show selected sections immediately when dragging
  Show text selection only when selection is within one section
  Allow deleting multiple sections
  Shouldn't combine paragraph toggle history with text edit history

  Some kind of help / tutorial
  
  * Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  * Should be able to select nothing
  * Should have nothing selected at first
  * Page up / down don't work
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)
  - autosave

  -- support cut + paste
  -- Reenable key presses when text is selected
  -- Reenable deleting selected text (and undo/redoing it)

Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
  updateSelection is called way too much
  changing paragraphs rerenders everything

Features:
  Add export functionality
  -- Speaker diarization
