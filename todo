audio:
  When dragging, don't update audio until release
  Option to continue / restart

sections:

  - automatically determine paragraph boundaries based on audio envelope
  - automatically combine sections

  -- manually split a section
  -- manually combine a section
  -- manually add a section

UX:
  Page up + page down don't work with text selected
  Can't click + drag if the selection starts with a space & can't select backwards
  When combining a paragraph, it selects the next paragraph for a second
  Some kind of button help
  
  * Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  * Should entering first character on placeholder replace it?
  * Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
  * Should be able to select nothing
  * Should have nothing selected at first
  
  - add scrolling (when playing from current position onwards)
  - undo / redo support / disable

  -- make logo background transparent
  -- support cut + paste
  -- Reenable key presses when text is selected
  -- support firefox + safari + edge


Performance:
  Slow when selecting and deselecting lots of sections
  updateSelection is called way too much


Add export functionality
