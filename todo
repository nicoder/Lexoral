UX:

  Should have nothing selected at first
  up + down arrows when no dropdown shouldn't do anything
  Reenable key presses when text is selected
  Shift + arrow keys doesnâ€™t select text
  Hard to tell difference between primary and secondary text colours
  Select multiple sections and press enter to accept all / why do we feel like we have to accept all of it?
