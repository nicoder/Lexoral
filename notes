Filled in by default
Not obvious you can click the dropdown
Can't get him to read it again in edit mode

selecting multiple then pressing enter plays lots in edit mode and also crashes it

should be awaiting loading the audio
should be able to click on the blank space

signal that you can use keyboard
escape + number hard without number pad

shift enter to remove new paragraph is confusing - use backspace instead?
