# Notes from miller using lexoral for the first time.

Not obvious you can click the dropdown
Can't get him to read it again in edit mode

selecting multiple then pressing enter plays lots in edit mode and also crashes it

should be awaiting loading the audio
should be able to click on the blank space

signal that you can use keyboard
escape + number hard without number pad

shift enter to remove new paragraph is confusing - use backspace instead?

trying to use up + down arrow keys in nav mode

use placeholder text with 1st option
want to be able to accept and then edit

undo / input onFocus should update selcetion store
+1 for alt to play like spacebar
enter should select the currently playing bit
keep as individual words
clicking in empty space taking you to nav mode is confusing (right click instead?)
remove underlines
escape mode if not typing 1st number, assume current

scrolling is really annoying
