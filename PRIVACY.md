## What data do we collect?

Lexoral collects the following data:

- Personal identification information (email address)
- Audio files uploaded to the platform
- Metadata provided when you send a request to our service, such as
  - IP address
  - Device signatures (mobile/desktop, browser version)
  - When the request was sent
  - What the request is for
- Any feedback given in user research sessions or online surveys

## How do we collect your data?

You provide Lexoral directly with all of the data we collect. We collect data and process it when you:

- Register an account online
- Upload a new transcript or edit an existing one
- Use the website while logged in to your account
- Voluntarily participate in user research or online surveys

## How do we use your data?

Lexoral collects your data so that we can:

- Secure your transcripts so that only you can access them
- Process your audio files and transcribe them
- Allow you to edit your transcripts
- Debug any issues you are having
- Optimise the platform based on how all of our customres use Lexoral, in aggregate
- Prevent malicious attacks on the platform, to ensure good service for everyone

Your data is processed on servers provided by *Google Cloud Platform*. They do not access or log your data while it is being processed.

Lexoral **does not** use your data to:

- Track you on other websites
- Sell to other companies
- Analyse the content of your transcripts for any purpose, except where you explicitly give permission for a specific transcript to be accessed by tech support in the process of helping you with an issue

## How do we store your data?

Lexoral securely stores your data in the cloud using services provided by *Google Cloud Platform*. When not being processed, your data is encrypted and stored on servers in the United Kingdom.

This means that even if someone stole the hard drives with your data on them, they would not be able to read your data. However, your data is not encrypted in transit, nor is it end-to-end encrypted. This means that there are no technical measures to prevent Lexoral from accessing your data, including your transcripts.

In other words, we are contractually prevented from accessing your data for illegitimate purposes by this privacy policy, rather than being physically unable to read your data.

Your data is only accessible to users logged in to your account.

Most processing is performed on servers in the United Kingdom, though this processing is orchestrated using servers in the Netherlands. Your audio and transcripts are processed only within the United Kindom.

## What are your Data Protection rights?

- **The right to access** - You have the right to request Lexoral for copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service.

- **The right to rectification** - You have the right to request that Lexoral correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Lexoral to complete the information you believe is incomplete.

- **The right to erasure** - You have the right to request that Lexoral erase your personal data, under certain conditions.
