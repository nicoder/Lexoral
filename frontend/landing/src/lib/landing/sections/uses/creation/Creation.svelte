<h3>Content Creation</h3>

<p>
  Adding subtitles to your videos is an essential part of making them accessible to everyone.
  The automatic captions never work right, and they certainly don't understand all the weird things you get up to. You'd love to make them better, but it all seems like magic.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever you end up doing, it's needs to fit your existing workflows. You're tight on time,
  but want high-quality subtitles that keep all your viewers on the same page.
</p>

<p>
  Simply upload your video to the dashboard, and it'll be auto-transcribed within minutes.
  Open the transcript, fix any mistakes, and export subtitles! We use standard file formats,
  supported by YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and many more.

  Lexoral makes sure your videos are for everyone - even people that lost their headphones
  behind the sofa.
