# APIs

Lexoral makes use of a number of APIs that need to be manually enabled before you can do `terraform apply` on a new project:

* Cloud Function
* Cloud Build
* Cloud Speech-to-Text
* Identity Platform

# In-console setup

Add an Email/Password provider to Identity Platform
Add lexoral.com as an authorized domain and remove the others in identity platform
